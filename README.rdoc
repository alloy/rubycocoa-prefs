== RubyCocoa prefs

A ruby abstraction for read/write access to the NSUserDefaults of a Cocoa application.
Originally written for a rewrite of the LimeChat preferences code.

LimeChat, the best irc client out there: http://github.com/psychs/limechat/tree/master
My rewrite of the preferences: http://github.com/alloy/limechat/tree/refactor_preferences

There is also a helper class which assists in making an array of strings accessible via
bindings.

=== Example

See the LimeChat source for a real life example.

  class Preferences
    class Keyword < Namespace
      defaults_accessor :highlight_enabled, false
    end
    
    # Register the default values with NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults.
    register_default_values!
  end

  # Elsewhere
  
  preferences.keyword.highlight_enabled # => false
  preferences.keyword.highlight_enabled? # => false
  
  # Setting a new value will save the preference with NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults,
  # which means the setting is in effect in memory and will be synchronized to disk every few minutes,
  # or by calling preferences.save.
  preferences.keyword.highlight_enabled = true
  
  preferences.keyword.highlight_enabled # => true
  preferences.keyword.highlight_enabled? # => true
